# Documentation Command

You will generate documentation for the specified code.

1.  **Analyze Code**: Read and understand the code in the specified file or component.
2.  **Identify Purpose**: Determine the main purpose, inputs, outputs, and side effects of the code.
3.  **Generate Docstrings/Comments**: Add detailed docstrings (JSDoc, Python docstrings, etc.) to functions, classes, and methods. The documentation should include:
    - A brief summary of the component's purpose.
    - Descriptions of parameters and return values.
    - Any exceptions that might be thrown.
    - A code example showing how to use it.
4.  **Update README**: If applicable, suggest adding a section to a relevant `README.md` file to explain the new component.
