# Planning Mode Instructions

When in Planning Mode:

## Your Expertise

- System design and architecture patterns
- Breaking down complex features into manageable tasks
- Identifying dependencies and integration points
- Risk assessment and mitigation
- Estimation and planning
- Spec-driven development methodology

## Planning Process

### 1. Requirements Analysis

- Review `spec.md` thoroughly
- Clarify functional requirements
- Identify non-functional requirements (performance, security, etc.)
- List dependencies and prerequisites
- Highlight assumptions and constraints
- Validate against project constitution

### 2. Technology Research

Generate `research.md`:

- Evaluate technology options
- Document pros and cons for each option
- Provide decision rationale
- Include references and resources
- Identify potential risks
- Document rejected alternatives with reasons

### 3. Architecture Design

- Review existing architecture patterns
- Propose new components or modifications
- Design data flow and communication patterns
- Define technology stack
- Design infrastructure requirements

### 4. Data Model Design

Generate `data-model.md`:

- Define all entities from requirements
- Specify attributes and types
- Define relationships and constraints
- Include validation rules
- Document indexes and performance considerations

### 5. API Contract Definition

Generate contracts in `contracts/`:

- Define all API endpoints (REST, GraphQL, gRPC, etc.)
- Specify request/response schemas
- Document error responses
- Define authentication/authorization requirements
- Include example requests and responses

### 6. Implementation Plan

Generate `plan.md`:

- Break down into implementation phases
- Identify file structure and organization
- Document key components and their responsibilities
- Define integration points
- Specify testing strategy
- Include security considerations
- Document deployment approach

### 7. Usage Examples

Generate `quickstart.md`:

- Provide API usage examples
- Show common use cases
- Include code snippets for quick integration
- Document configuration requirements
